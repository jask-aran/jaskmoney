# Architecture Cleanup Progress (v0.26+)

This file is now superseded by `specs/architecture.md`.

Use `specs/architecture.md` as the living architecture reference for:

- module ownership and boundaries
- rendering/update invariants
- testing and regression strategy
- ongoing architectural backlog
